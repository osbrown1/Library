book to copy = one to many
one to many with location and books and establish that relationship via list to narrow down relationship between books and copies

books views - need links to appropriate pages
      - integrate copies views into books views (functionality includes: increase or decrease copy count from within the details page (either int box on page, or link to a copies edit view))
      
      click on the specific book in the book index. that would take you to specific book details including author of said book. click on link for copies on hand and copies checked out.

the site does one thing: access to library

a librarian would enter user and password and have full access to library

a regular user would only have access to a portion of what the librarian has access to.
